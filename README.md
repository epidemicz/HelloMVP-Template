# HelloMVP-Template
A visual studio template for a basic (bare) Winforms Application utilizing the Model-View-Presenter pattern.

## Installing
##### Get the release (easiest)
Get the latest release [here](https://github.com/epidemicz/HelloMVP-Template/releases/latest), then see steps #2 and #3 below.

##### From source
Alternatively, if you get the source directly:

1. Zip the entire contents of the `HelloMVP-Template` directory such that the root of the zip contains the following structure:
  - `MVP`
  - `MVP.Core`
  - `MVP.Presentation`
  - `mvp.vstemplate`

2. Copy the zip to `%userprofile%\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Templates\ProjectTemplates`.
3. Open visual studio and you should see `MVP Basic Template`.


## Just want to see the example without the template bother?
If you would like to see just a working example of the HelloMVP project, see my repository for that [here](https://github.com/epidemicz/HelloMVP).
